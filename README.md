# Stroke-Prediction
Stroke Prediction Using Smote Technique


## Problem Statement

**What is Stroke ?**

It happens when the brain's blood vessels become narrowed or blocked, causing severely reduced blood flow (ischemia). Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through your bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels in your brain.

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted. Most strokes result from a blood clot blocking a blood vessel in the brain or neck.

Our goal here is to predict whether person will get stroke or no based on some features that we have
